# Michael Joseph S. Lee's Master's Thesis Repository

## Description
This is a repository for Michael Joseph S. Lee's master's thesis.

## Contents
- **``Code/``** - Contains the code I used in my thesis
  - **``Code/DORT Background/``** - Contains the MATLAB scripts that I used to make the figures demonstrating DORT in the "DORT Background" chapter of my thesis
  - **``Code/MATLAB Experiments/``** - Contains the MATLAB scripts that I used to do the experiments in the "MATLAB Experiments" chapter of my thesis
  - **``Code/Holotorch Experiment/``** - Contains a link (in ``Code/Holotorch Experiment/README.md``) to the ``SW-DORT-Research-Code`` repository, which contains the code that I used to perform the experiment in the "Holotorch Experiment" chapter of my thesis
    - The ``SW-DORT-Research-Code`` repository can be found at https://github.com/mich-lee/SW-DORT-Research-Code/
    - The ``SW-DORT-Research-Code`` repository requires the repository at https://github.com/mich-lee/holofork
      - Download ``holofork`` repository and have it as the ``holotorch-lib`` folder in the downloaded ``SW-DORT-Research-Code`` repository
    - The ``THESIS EXPERIMENTS`` folder in the ``SW-DORT-Research-Code`` repository contains code that I used to generate and analyze data for the experiment in the "Holotorch Experiment" chapter of my thesis
      - ``SW-DORT-Research-Code/THESIS EXPERIMENTS/Generate_Data (aberrating layer 7mm in front of scatterer plane).py`` - Generates data
        - This script will generate a file containing data.
      - ``SW-DORT-Research-Code/THESIS EXPERIMENTS/Analyze_Data (THESIS).py`` - Analyzes the data generated by ``SW-DORT-Research-Code/THESIS EXPERIMENTS/Generate_Data (aberrating layer 7mm in front of scatterer plane).py``
        - When using this script, set the "dataFilePath" variable in this script to point to the data generated by the ``SW-DORT-Research-Code/THESIS EXPERIMENTS/Generate_Data (aberrating layer 7mm in front of scatterer plane).py`` script
